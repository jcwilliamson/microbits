# Microbits Lab
## Programming The Microbit
* Connect the Microbit to the computer using the Micro USB cable.
* Go to https://makecode.microbit.org/
* Here, you'll see The option to write code for your microbit in 2 ways, either with blocks, or using Javascript. The blocks mode is very similar to scratch.
When you're happy with the program you have written, press the download button in the bottom left. After doing this, the code can be dragged onto the microbit in file explorer, and the microbit will run it.

## Activity 1
To do: 
[]Write an activity, do something basic to get them familiar with writing code for the microbit

## Activity 2
To do: 
[] Write an activity involving passing a message between the 2 microbits using RF. 

## Activity 3
To do:
 [] Write an activity, probably involving digital IO, maybe some analogue things, or possibly something with motor control, introduce breadboards.

## Activity 4: Remote Control Robots
todo:
[]find suitable chassis for robots
 Using what you have done previously, you should now be able to build a remote control robot using 2 microbits, one to control it, and one to control the motors. You will find that the output pins on the Microbit are not powerful enough to control the motors directly. You may have wondered what the small components with 3 pins are for. These are called transistors, and they are very useful in electronics, because they let you produce a large output from a small input.

 Above is a diagram of the transistor that you will be using. Notice that one side of the transistor is flat, and the other is curved, this is to help you see which way it is facing. You should connect the pin called the emmitter to your motor, the pin labeled collector to your AA battery pack, and the pin labeled base to one of the pins on your Microbit (if you need help with this, feel free to ask one). You should now be able to control a motor using the connections on the Microbit.
 
 Now you have done this, think about how you could make your robot drive in a straight line and steer using the second microbit. To help you
